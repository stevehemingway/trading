Everyone knows what Nestlé does.
It sells food, for humans and their pets.
It's a boring business, which sells the same amount of stuff every year.
Its beta is 0.26: it's equity is practically a bond.
It throws off CHF 13 mmm every year in free cashflow.
Its products are not discretionary: even if people are squeezed by inflation, they will still buy their box of Cheerios, Nescafé, Felix cat food and Häagen-Dazs icecream.

It's return on equity is 36%, and it's trailing P/E is under 20.
OK, buying the Swiss equity means shorting the CHF, which is always a dangerous thing to do,
but one can hedge cheaply (into Turkish Lira, perhaps?).

Anyway, that's the bull thesis. The bear case is that it's ex-growth, it doesn't have the aggressive management of P&G or the private equity freedom of Mars and that it's just too damn expensive (i.e. the bull case is fully priced in). Well, it was CHF 113 in 2019, and it's about CHF 117 now.
