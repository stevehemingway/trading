Celsius is a maker of soft drinks.
It's expensive, having a P/E of 684, going down to 227 on a forward (forecast earnings) basis.
It operates in a crowded segment, and has to stand up to companies like Coca Cola.
It is paying out $37mm in stock-based compensation, out of a net income from continuing operations of $10mm. 
It has low debt, and has some very large exceptionals recently ($275mm in calendar 21, $137mm so far this year).

The bull case for the stock seems to be that it's growing sales rapidly, it's a 'fitness' drink (and so quite different from an ordinary soda), it may be a takeover target, and that it is easily confused with the 'crypto lender platform' of the same name. I'm not sure that the last is part of the bull case any longer, as the other Celsius has now filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
